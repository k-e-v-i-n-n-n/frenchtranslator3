-----French/English Translator-----

Overview

Welcome to my French/English translator, which can be used to translate between the two languages, as well as to store words or phrases you'd like to reference later.

Translate

On the translate page, first select the which languge you'd like to translate from by toggling the areas between the two text areas. When the text area on the left is in the langauge you want to translate from, simply enter your text and press the button "Translate."

Words

Once you have received a translation, you can save it to your list of words by clicking the "Save Word" button. This will then save it to your list of words which you can view by clicking on the "Words" link in the navigation at the top of the page. If you'd like to delete an entry, simply click the "x" in the lower right of the entry to remove it.

Phrases

Similar to the Words section, once you have received a translation, you can save it to your list of phrases by clicking the "Save Phrase" button. This will then save it to your list of Phrases which you can view by clicking on the "Phrases" link in the navigation at the top of the page. If you'd like to delete an entry, simply click the "x" in the lower right of the entry to remove it.
